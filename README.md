# StudySync Landing Page

This is a static, single-page website for "StudySync," a fictional e-learning platform. The project is built purely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, demonstrating a clean, modern web design.

## ✨ Features

This landing page is divided into several key sections:

* **Header:** A clean navigation bar with the company logo, navigation links (Home, Features, etc.), and a "Contact Us" call-to-action button.
* **Hero Section:** A prominent "above-the-fold" area with a compelling headline, descriptive text, and primary action buttons ("Start" and "Take Tour").
* **Social Proof:** A "Trusted by the best" section displaying logos of partner companies like Google, Microsoft, and LinkedIn.
* **Competitive Advantage:** A feature showcase using a **CSS Grid** layout to present six key benefits of the platform (e.g., Personalized Learning, Affordability).
* **Testimonials:** A three-column layout (using **Flexbox**) to display positive reviews from users.
* **Newsletter Signup:** A section to capture user emails for a newsletter, complete with an input field and send button.
* **Footer:** A comprehensive, multi-column footer with links for Product, Company, Support, and Legal, as well as social media icons.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and content of the webpage.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including layout, colors, fonts, and hover effects.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Used for aligning items in the header, footer, and other containers.
* **CSS Grid:** Used to create the 2-column layout for the "Competitive Advantage" (section 2) cards.

**Note:** This project is currently not responsive, as the media queries are commented out in the CSS file.
